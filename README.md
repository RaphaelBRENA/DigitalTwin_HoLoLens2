# DigitalTwin_HoLoLens2

A research internship project on mixed reality interfaces with HoloLens 2, Unity and MRTK, including the creation of interactive 3D controls for industrial simulations. Also investigated procedural 3D modelling techniques in Houdini to generate customizable and parametric reactor models.

## ⚠️ Important Note

The commit history reflects the iterative and often exploratory development process of the internship. Commits were made frequently to track progress, resulting in a project state that is disjointed and highly likely to be non-compilable or non-functional if cloned and run immediately. It is uploaded primarily for archival purposes and to showcase the technologies used and the scope of work completed during the stage.
